# Singly Linked List
This application implements a singly linked list data structure using C++. It includes various methods for constructing, inserting, removing, and manipulating elements within the list.

## Features
- Construct a linked list using a default constructor or from an initializer list.
- Insert elements at the beginning of the list using `push_front` or `push_front_range`.
- Insert elements with `assign`, `assign_range`, `insert_after`, `insert_range_after`.
- Remove elements from the beginning of the list using `pop_front`.
- Remove elements from the list using `remove` and `remove_after`.
- Clear the contents of the list using `clear`.
- Reverse the order of elements in the list using `reverse`.
- Split the list based on a specified predicate using `split_when`.
- Access elements by index using the `operator[]` method.

## Usage
After building the application, you can run the executable to test the linked list methods. Modify the main function in the main.cpp file to include the operations you want to test.
